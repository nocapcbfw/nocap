  <h4><center>DESCRIBE MY MUSIC LOVE</center></h4>
   My fav artist is future/thug, sorry can't choose number 1 b/w them ðŸ˜… they've helped me a lot through
   their music like when i got my heart broken 3years ago, I had to spin future for straight 2 weeks as to help 
   me heal while Thug album punk was there for me to push my myself beyond my limits everyday, but suprisingly for me 
   my best/fav song doesn't come from them. its still me by NoCap. Man that song is crack in my vein, NoCap developed 
   into my top 5 artirst w gunna and wizkid completing it. I love music a lot, its like an escape from deep thoughts 
   but not really sometimes , I just love music

<H4><center>WHAT DO I WISH FOR YOURSELF?</center></H4>
    SO many things, from becoming a master in programming, to become a billionaire to owning that maybach and then
    get to smoke w thug and future one day. but one thing i really do wish now is that <strong>GOD</strong> blesses me a lot and 
    guides my journey to not live a medicore life w long life and good health along the way

<h4><center>WHO'S MY FAVOURITE PERSON?</center></h4>
  <strong>MY MOM</strong>. I don't think i have to think that answer as she has always been right from when i was born. she has
  taken some risks in my life and i would do anything to see me and her enjoying the best-sweet future together
